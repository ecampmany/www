<div dir="ltr"><div><b>Tell Me About Yourself.</b></div><div></div><div>I'm 45 years old. I live in small village near Barcelona. I am married and I have two daughters, aged seven and ten each. <br></div><div><br></div><div>I've been working
 as wind modeller for the last 10 years in a small company called 
Vortex. We are just 14 workers. We basically run the wrf model to 
downscale the reanalysis data, Era5, CFSR, Merra2 to provide high 
resolution data for wind resource assessment. My main tasks are 
programming scripts to automatically download the reanalysis data, 
prepare the files to be used in the model, translate the output in a 
more user-friendly format for our users, etc...<br></div><div><br></div><div>Before
 that, I did some postdoctoral research in the UK and the United States 
focused in aerosol and cloud retrievals from satellite imagery. <br></div><div>I
 studied my Bachelor of Science in the University of Barcelona where I 
also obtained my PhD degree with a thesis based on solar ultraviolet 
radiation models.</div><div><br></div><div>When I'm not in front the computer, I like to read, cook new recipes, and play old music records in my turntable.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Why Are You the Best Person for the Job?</b></div><div>Probably
 I'm not the best candidate for this job. I'm sure there are some 
experts in grib format already working within the ECMWF. I think also 
NCAR conducted a migration from grib1 to grib2 in the past, so probably 
there might be a couple of good candidates in there.</div><div>Having 
said that, I've been working with grib files for 10 years, with large 
volumes of datasets,&nbsp; I am methodical and organized in my work and I 
believe that I can contribute to the project with experience but also 
the enthusiasm and strength of someone who starts a new venture. </div><div><b></b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b><b>Why Do You Want This Job?</b></b></div><div><span lang="en"><span><span> I am looking for new challenges.</span></span> <span><span>I
 think that working at the ECMWF is a good opportunity to learn 
different methodologies, to be in contact with experts in many different
 areas.</span></span> <span><span>I have visited the ECMWF a couple of times in the past and I think it is a really inspiring and rewarding environment.</span></span> <span><span>I feel like this job is a great career change for me.</span></span> <span><span>The reputation of the ECMWF is extraordinary, not even for me, but for all my colleagues.</span></span></span> </div><div><br></div><div><b>What are your weaknessesâ€¦?</b></div><div>I
 work best in well-defined goals, so I can concentrate on my objectives,
 rather than with very open proposals. After doing my research during my
 doctoral and postdoctoral period, when I changed a private company, I 
discovered that I fit well with all its specified objectives and 
deadlines. I also found kind of boring writing peer-reviewed 
publications, I prefer working in developing a new product, testing it 
and releasing it to market and see the response, this is more rewarding 
to me.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Why Are You Leaving Your Job?</b></div><div><span lang="en"><span><span><span lang="en"><span><span>My intention is to arrange a two-year unpaid leave.</span></span> <span><span>I think my current employer will agree that this is a win-win situation.</span></span> <span><span>I can learn many things and skills that are valuable to the company.</span></span> <span><span>After
 a period of 10 years, I feel very comfortable in my job, so there is a 
risk of stagnation and this is an opportunity to reinvent myself and 
learn from new challenges.</span></span> <span><span>I am constantly trying to learn, in the last few months I have been working with python and jupiter notebooks.</span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div><span lang="en"><span><span><span lang="en"><span><span><br></span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div><span lang="en"><span><span><span lang="en"><span><span>On a personal level, my wife and I really enjoyed our two-year stay in England in the past so we would like to repeat the experience this time with our daughters. We have visited the UK twice during our summer vacations and we are delighted with the countryside, the history, the culture. We have even come to appreciate the British cuisine! Except for Marmite, I mean, we do love England, but not that much!<br></span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div><span lang="en"><span><span></span></span></span> </div><div><br></div><div><b>When can you start work?</b></div><div>I have some commitments with my employer, we are finishing some projects, so I don't think I can start before the end of this year. I would say that I can start in January, but I don't know if the covid situation will be complicated by then. Thinking of my family, I believe it would be easy for them to relocate during Easter, so we have time to find a house, a school.... I wonder if it would be possible to start working with a combination of homeworking and short visits in Reading for the first three months and from April coming to E.C.M.W.F. headquarters on regular basis.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>What was your most successful / last project?</b></div><div>Our company created an external spin-off company for the wind forecast market. I worked side by side with an external team to translate our project databases for use in their system that is housed in Google's cloud machines. It was a difficult task but also an opportunity to learn how a remote cluster works.<br></div><div><font size="2"></font></div><div><br></div><div><b>How would you approach this project?</b><br></div>When I firstly read the job offer, just for a second I thought: two years to convert all the grib files of E.C.M.W.F. from version1 to version2? I can do it in two weeks and not the mapping but the actual migration.<br>Then of course you realize this is a massive task, there are lot of details you need the control, the different resolution in the dimensions from one version to another: milli-degrees instead of micro-degrees, longitudes from 0 to 360 instead of -180 to 180, etc...<br>Besides MARS archive has years of existence, with petabytes of data with millions of files and billions of meteorological fields.<br>Operative datasets as Era5 have both grib1 and grib2 depending on if you are downloading model levels or pressure levels, so I think I have the enough knowledge to reckon this is a huge job that has to be addressed with caution and respect.<br><div>There are several tools to use for convert grib1 to grib2: the EC codes developed by E.C.M.W.F., the CDO libraries from Max Planck Institute, and the cnvgrib and wgrib2 tools both from NCEP. I think the right tool to use here is the EC codes as it supports all the parameters from E.C.M.W.F. I particularly like the python module CF grib to read grib files as X array with just one line of code. <br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Questions?</b></div><div>The 2-year period for the job is a rough estimate or was actually evaluated in detail?</div><div>How is ECMWF still currently producing grib1 versions of relatively recent products as Era5 released in 2016 since grib2 was introduced in 2001?</div><div><span lang="en"><span><span>The same data set is available as grib1 or grib2 depending on whether you download it with model levels or pressure levels.</span></span> <span><span>Are there two versions in MARS or is the data post-processed on the fly when downloaded?</span></span></span></div><div></div><div></div><div>I got the impression that the migration is very important, why hire a new person when probably there are very qualified workers competent with grib already in Reading?</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>I know that in my application form I wrote 15 days, but that was in 
August, when all the projects in which I participated were closed.</div></div>
