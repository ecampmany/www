<h1>Atmospheric Reanalysis</h1>
Reanalysis integrates model data with observations worldwide to create a globally comprehensive and consistent dataset through the application of physical laws. This process, known as <b>data assimilation</b>, mirrors the methodology employed by numerical weather prediction centers. At regular intervals (e.g., every 12 hours at ECMWF), a previous forecast is merged with newly available observations using an optimal approach to generate a refined estimate of the atmospheric state, known as <b>analysis</b>. This analysis serves as the foundation for producing updated and enhanced forecasts.<p>

Observations have historically been <b>unevenly</b> distributed and prone to errors. Even with advancements in satellite technology, relying solely on observations cannot offer a comprehensive and precise depiction of the Earth's system worldwide at any given moment. Reanalyses play a crucial role in bridging the gaps in the observational record. They provide <b>consistent temporal coverage</b>, thereby reducing the likelihood of spurious signals of change

<h2>CFSR reanalysis</h2>
Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) was released by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NOAA) in 2010. Spatial resolution is <b>0.5 by 0.5 degrees</b> of latitude and longitude with 37 vertical levels (64 model). Temporal resolution of <b>6 hours</b> (00, 06, 12 and 18 UTC) extending from 1979 up to present. Updated daily, with a latency of just one day. 
<p><br>
<h2>MERRA2 reanalysis</h2>
The second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA2) was released by NASA in 2016 to replace MERRA. Spatial resolution is <b>0.625 degrees</b> of longitude by <b>0.5 degrees</b> of latitude with 42 vertical levels (72 model). Temporal resolution of <b>6 hours</b> (00, 06, 12 and 18 UTC) extending from 1980 up to present, updated monthly with a latency of one and a half month. 
<p><br>
<h2>ERA5 reanalysis</h2>
The fifth-generation reanalysis by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) was introduced in 2018, to replace the ERA-Interim reanalysis. It has a spatial resolution is <b>0.25 by 0.25 degrees</b> of latitude and longitude with 37 vertical levels (137 model). Temporal resolution is <b>hourly</b> extending from 1940 up to present. Updated daily with a latency of approximately five days, ERA5 ensures timely access to critical data. It's worth noting that an initial release, referred to as ERA5T, precedes the final version by 2 to 3 months. Any significant discrepancies identified in ERA5T may be rectified in subsequent releases.

<h2>Reanalysis in wind resource assessment</h2>
Due to the limited availability of long-term measurements with adequate coverage at heights relevant to wind power applications, reanalysis datasets have become a preferred data source for large-scale wind power analyses. These datasets offer comprehensive coverage over vast geographical areas and extended time periods.
<p>
Reanalysis datasets are particularly useful for extending short observation datasets to the long term using correlation techniques such as <b>Measure Correlate Predict (MCP)</b>. Additionally, they serve as valuable initial estimates for energy assessments during the early stages of project development, especially during <b>greenfield prospecting</b>.
<p>
However, reanalysis data can exhibit a wide range of biases due to the inherent limitations of model resolution. To mitigate this issue, <b>mesoscale modeling</b> techniques are employed to enhance the <b>resolution</b> of coarse reanalysis data. This involves downscaling the native resolution of reanalysis datasets to higher resolutions through the utilization of multiple nested simulations, thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of wind resource assessments.
