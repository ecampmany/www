<h1>Comparison of ERA5 and MERRA2 reanalysis</h1>
This study presents a global comparative analysis of wind speed data from the ERA5 and MERRA2 reanalysis datasets over the last decade (2013-2023). The core objective was to evaluate the spatial and temporal consistency between these two critical data sources for wind resource assessment.
<p>
The analysis used the coefficient of correlation (R²) to map and identify global regions of high and low agreement. Key findings revealed significant spatial and temporal divergences:
<p>
Spatial Variations: While many regions show strong correlation (R² ~1.0), significant discrepancies were identified in areas with complex terrain or specific climatic conditions, such as the Amazon basin, the Andes, and the Great Rift Valley in East Africa.
<p>
Temporal Variations: Correlation levels were not static, fluctuating from year to year (e.g., in the Iberian Peninsula) and throughout the year, highlighting the dynamic nature of dataset alignment.
<p>
The conclusion emphasizes that these inconsistencies between reanalysis products are a crucial source of uncertainty. For accurate wind energy projections, particularly in susceptible regions, it is essential to account for these dataset differences in wind resource assessment models.
